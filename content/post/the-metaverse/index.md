### Introduction
Allot have been going on on the internet since Mark Zuckerberg the CEO of Facebook announced the change of the Name of Facebook to Meta, which is a short form for the word Metaverse. There have been a lot of questions asking why. Different people have their opinions. In this article, we will look at what the metaverse is and what it holds for the future.

### What is the metaverse?
According to Wikipedia, the metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets.
The metaverse is a world created by men to mirror the physical world, in the metaverse men have developed another Earth where you find every country in the physical earth mirrored in it. Real estate properties are currently selling in the metaverse where you can buy any portion of the earth you want of course if you have the money.
The Metaverse is being built in such a way we all can have a presence in it using avatars.

### What is an Avatar 
An Avatar has a lot of meaning depending on context. In our Context,
An Avatar is a virtual representation of a human in the virtual world. I.e any 2D or  3D illustration set to represent a human either as a profile picture, a character in a game, or whatsoever virtual platform can be called an avatar. Facebook (now Meta) is currently experimenting with codex avatars that reconstruct human appearance in the virtual world with incredible accuracy. In the Metaverse, you can use the digital look of your physical self so you can look more of yourself. The metaverse will allow you to buy clothes, shoes, and other things, so you can make your avatar look good just as you look good in the physical world. This means you will be able to have the same experience you have in the physical world. The metaverse is accessed using a virtual reality headset, even though in the future we might end up using smart glasses to go into the metaverse.

A virtual reality(VR) headset is a head-mounted device that provides virtual reality for anyone who wears it. This takes you inside the virtual space, Playing Video Gamers using the VR headset gives you the reality of the game. I.e you participate in the game inside the game.

The Future of the metaverse.
The metaverse holds a lot of potential for giving the experience of the virtual space just as it's shown in Sci-Fi movies. The Metaverse will be used in So many industries such as; 

**entertainment**: The metaverse will enable music Concerts to hold so that everybody on Earth can join virtually and have a real-life experience of a concert. Something similar has happened where Travis Scout had a concert on Fortnight.

 **Education**: A time will come were going to school on the internet will be more realistic, at that time, all you will have to do is take up a smart Glass or a VR headset and join a class or lecture, and you will be able to relate and feel the presence of your teacher and classmate at this point all information on the internet will be on our fingertips.

**Cooperation**: The metaverse will create a more realistic virtual meeting space where all participants of the meeting will be present using their avatars and all expressions and reactions of participants will be seen in their avatars.

There will be many more possibilities with the metaverse due to the fact that the order of the world has changed due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the pandemic has changed the way humans do things, people now prefer to work and do things from home than they used to be. The metaverse is a new space we need to look into, because whether people accept it now or not one day everybody will have to use the metaverse.
