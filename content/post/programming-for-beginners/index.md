### Introduction
To understand computer programming there is a need to understand what programming means in a general sense. Programming can be seen as the design of plans and schedules to achieve a goal. If I design a plan I took to reach a goal, I can say I have a program to achieve that kind of goal. Let's look at computer programming.

### Computer Programming
Computer Programming is the process of designing instructions for a computer to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a  task. Programming includes generating ***algorithms** (which is a step-by-step process to solving a computing problem)*. Algorithms are translated to a language the computer can understand using a process known as **coding**.  Coding is done using programming languages.

### Coding 
Computers are like switches whose operations are either on or off. This series of on and off is what enables computers to perform the way they do. The on and off in computers are represented using 1 and 0 where 1 = on and 0 = off which is known as binary. So
**coding is the translation of a program or algorithm to the language computers can understand using a programming language**.

### Programming Languages
If computer programs were to be written in 1 and 0, programming would have been very bulky, and writing computer programs would have been very tedious. Programming languages allow us to write programs in a human-readable language and then compile it for the computer to understand. So Programming languages are languages programmers use to write programs or instructions for a computer to carry out, in such a way that the program can be compiled to the language a computer understands. There are so many programming languages today including;
- Python
- Java
- C#
- C
- PHP
- JavaScript
- Ruby

and lots more as a beginner python is mostly recommended because of its simplified syntax.

### How to learn and master programming
One Truth about programming is that programming is hard, it requires patience and discipline. To save yourselves from future trouble in our programming journey it is mostly advised to have an understanding of the basics of programming and then start building projects. Below is a list of the programming basics you must be familiar with to start building projects. The understanding of the below concepts will help a lot during debugging.
- Data types: Data types will make you familiar with how data is represented in computer programs.
- Variable: Variable will make you familiar with how to store this data and how to access them in programs.
-  Array or list: Array or list will make you familiar with how to store and access data when it's bulky.
- Control flow(conditional statements): control flow will make you familiar with how to arrange programs in the order they need to be executed.
- Loops:  loops will make you familiar with how to repeat processes or programs as many times as needed.
- Functions: Functions will make you familiar with how to not repeat yourself while writing code.
- Classes and objects: will make you familiar with how to reuse code so you don't always build programs from scratch.

with the above, you can start working on simple projects. when you start to get familiar with writing programs you find need to learn 
- Data Structures and Algorithm.

### Conclusion
We looked at what computer programming, coding, and programming languages are then we looked at the basic topics to be familiar with when starting programming, the understanding of the above topics will make learning programming easy. Tell me what you think in the comment section below.
