### iPhone 13 rumors: All the buzz on the next iPhone ahead of Apple's Sept. 14 event

Apple's new iPhone is set for launch on Sept. 14. Here's everything we've heard so far about the iPhone 13's price, specs and more.

Apple's iPhone 13 is on its way with an online-only event set for Sept. 14. The new iPhone is expected to debut with a collection of new features, upgraded camera specs, new color options (maybe even bubblegum pink) and an updated design with a notchless display. Although we'll likely see the new iPhone next week, rumors about the iPhone 13 continue to buzz ahead of its release date. 

The latest iPhone 13 gossip came from a filing with the Federal Communications Commission for a revised MagSafe charger spotted by 9to5Mac and MacRumors. In the filing, Apple references four new iPhone models alongside the four "legacy" iPhone 12 models: the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. 

We've previously heard that the iPhone 13 lineup will feature four phones -- the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max -- as predicted by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This lineup matches the four iPhone 12 models from last year. But that's not all that's staying the same: The iPhone 13's price might be familiar as well.
