### Introduction
Computers are dumb they don't understand anything on their own, they rely heavily on programs to make them function. That's why a computer without an operating system is useless. The operating system is the program that manages the hardware and software of a computer. Sofware is what manages the data users give to the computer to process which is the primary function of a computer. During the process of programming this software, the programmer will have to identify the type of data the software will be receiving, processing, or storing.

### What is a Data type in programming?
In programming, a data type is an attribute associated with data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer wants the software to use the data. A data type associated with a variable is what will make the computer treat "1234" either as a string or as a number. the number and type of data type differ depending on programming language, but there are a few that are common in all languages These few include; integers, strings, characters, and boolean. In the cause of this article, we will look at examples of data types in python.

### Types of data types in python.
#### Python Numbers
This data type is Tells the program to treat data as numbers;

- Integers(int): int tells the program to treat data as whole numbers.
```
123
```
- Floating Point (float): float tells the program to treat data as decimals.
```
2.3
```
- Complex number: this number tells the program to treat data complex numbers i.e. numbers with real and imaginary section parts eg.
```
x + yj

5 + 3j
```
### Python String
The String data type tells the program to treat data as a sequence of Unicode characters. The string data type is defined with a single or double quotation sign (' ' or " "). A string look as shown below
```python
'hello world' or
"hello world"
```
#### Python List
The list data type tells the program to treat data as a collection of items not minding their data type. Lists are defined with square brackets [ ]. A list looks as shown below.
```
[1, 2.3, father]
```
### Python Tuple
The tuple data type is similar to the list data type, the difference between the list and a tuple is that tuples are immutable while lists are mutable which means that the items in a tuple can't be altered but those of a list can be altered. A tuple is defined with a parenthesis ( ). A tuple looks as shown below.
```
(2, 'mother', 3 + 4j )
```

#### Python Dictionary
The dictionary data type is also like the list data type but in dictionaries, each item is represented with a key. Dictionaries are defined with curly braces { }. A dictionary looks as shown below.
```
{ "name": "John", "age": 23}
```
#### Python Set
The set data types tell a program that data is a collection of unique items that are in sets. Just like dictionaries the set data type is defined with curly braces. A set data type is shown below.
```
{2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,5}
```
#### Bolean Data Type
The boolean data type tells a program that data can only be `true' or `false` .

the seven data types above are the most popular data types a programmer will mostly work with when coding in python.

### Conclusion 
In programming learning data types is a basic foundation that can not be neglected. In this article, we looked at what data types are and some data types that are common in almost all programming languages, we also looked at some of the most popular data types in python. 

I hope you have a good understanding of data types after reading this article, leave a comment in the comment section if you have any suggestions or questions.
