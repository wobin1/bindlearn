A Variable is like a container with a label or name tag on it. The label or name tag enables the referencing of whatever is stored inside it. Variables in programming allocate memory space and stores data or information given to it, allowing programmers to reference the stored data or information with a name given to the variable. Access to data or information stored is given whenever the variable name is called. Data stored in a variable can always change or vary just as the name variable suggests.

### Variables
Variables simply store data or information which will later be referenced or manipulated later in a program.

### How to create variables
Creating variables may differ depending on the programming language, in some programming languages you need to specify the [data type](https://www.bindlearn.com/post/data-types-in-python/) the variable can store, while other languages automatically dictate the [data type](https://www.bindlearn.com/post/data-types-in-python/). Some programming languages make you declare variables before assignment while some create variables the moment a value is assigned to them. Below is how variables are created.

#### Python
```python
name = "John"
age = 23
print(name)
print(age)
```
#### Java
```java
String name = "John";
int age = 23
System.out.println(name);
System.out.println(age);
```
 As seen above creating a variable in python does not require anything extra. The variable is created without specifying the data type. This is because python does not need a compiler to run programs.

Java requires the assignment of data type before variables are stored, 
because Java requires a compiler to run programs, and the compiler will have to check for compatibility to avoid errors.

>Note: In programming, the sign `=` is for declaring variable while `==` is for equality.

### Conclusion
The concept of variables is one of the backbones of programming. We were able to understand what variables are and how to create them. Feel free to drop a comment or question in the comment section below. I will be glad to reply to them.
